# Weather App

A production-ready weather forecasting web application built with modern frontend technologies.\
It fetches real-time weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and displays it in a clean, responsive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** â€“ React framework for hybrid static and server rendering.
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[Lucide-React](https://lucide.dev/)** â€“ Icon library for consistent and beautiful SVG icons.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)** â€“ Promise-based HTTP client for seamless API interaction.
- **[React-Hot-Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)** â€“ Lightweight notifications library for user feedback.
- **[V0.dev](https://v0.dev/)** â€“ Used for generating initial UI components.
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** â€“ Primary code editor.
- **[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt)** â€“ Assisted with refining certain parts of code logic.

## Features

- Fetch current weather data for any city worldwide.
- Real-time temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
- Loading states and error handling with toast notifications.
- Fully responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Modular component-based architecture.
- Minimalistic and accessible UI/UX.

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd weather-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Visit
http://localhost:3000
```

## API Integration

This application uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data.\
You must obtain a free API key by creating an account on their platform.

To configure the API key:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
2. Add your API key:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The API requests are handled using **Axios**, and weather data is displayed dynamically based on the user's input.

---

## Applicability

This project is an ideal starting point for:

- Learning full-stack React development with API integration.
- Understanding real-world asynchronous data fetching patterns.
- Implementing user feedback with toasts and error handling.
- Developing responsive web interfaces using TailwindCSS.
- Showcasing portfolio-ready frontend development skills.

---

## Deployment

The application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), leveraging Next.js' optimized performance and serverless capabilities.
